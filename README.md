- 👋 Hi, I’m @tbewley (Prof Thomas Bewley at UC San Diego, and founder of Renaissance Robotics)
- 👀 I’m currently working on two textbooks:
       Renaissance Robotics: embedding multithreaded real-time feedback into mobile robots and cyber-physical systems
       Numerical Renaissance: simulation, optimization, and control
- 👀 I will be using this github repository to store all the codes associated with these two texts.
- 📫 Please reach out to me at bewley@eng.ucsd.edu with any bug reports, etc.
