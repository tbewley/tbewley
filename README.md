- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tbewley, aka Thomas Bewley.  I am a professor at UC San Diego, and the founder of <a href="https://www.renaissancerobotics.com/">Renaissance Robotics</a>.
- I have three textbooks in the works (focusing now mostly on the first, #2 and 3 will be finished up in due course...), draft:
- ðŸ“– <a href="http://robotics.ucsd.edu/RR.pdf">Renaissance Robotics: embedding multithreaded real-time feedback into mobile robots and cyber-physical systems</a> (RR),
- ðŸ“– <a href="http://robotics.ucsd.edu/NR.pdf">Numerical Renaissance: simulation, optimization, and control</a> (NR)
- ðŸ“– <a href="http://robotics.ucsd.edu/rp.html">Renaissance Packings: n-dimensional discretization for error correction, coordination, and search</a> (RP)
- RR is an undergraduate-level introduction to a rigorous framework for analysis-based design of unmanned system; NR and RP are graduate-level treatises on numerical methods and lattice theory and their numerous applications.
- I am now using a newly consolidated Renaissance Repository (<a href="https://github.com/tbewley/RR">RR</a>) on Github to store all the codes I develop associated with these three major projects, which are fairly tightly coupled and cross referenced.
- I have also posted here a codebase for the simulation of tensegrity systems, dubbed <a href="https://github.com/tbewley/TenSim">TenSim</a>.
- ðŸ“« For bug reports related to the codes, I prefer normal github style pull requests.
- ðŸ“« Please reach out to me at tbewley@ucsd.edu with book typos/suggestions, broken links, and other questions/suggestions.
