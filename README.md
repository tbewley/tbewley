- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tbewley, aka Prof Thomas Bewley at UC San Diego, and founder of Renaissance Robotics
- Iâ€™m currently working on two textbooks:
- ðŸ“– Renaissance Robotics: embedding multithreaded real-time feedback into mobile robots and cyber-physical systems
- ðŸ“– Numerical Renaissance: simulation, optimization, and control
- I am using this github repository to store all the codes associated with these two texts (RR and NR),
- in addition to (time permitting) various other projects I am working on that I'd like to share with the world. 
- ðŸ“« Please reach out to me at bewley@eng.ucsd.edu with details regarding any bug reports, pull requests, etc.
