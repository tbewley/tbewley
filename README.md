- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tbewley, aka Thomas Bewley.
- I am a professor at UC San Diego, and the founder of <a href="https://www.renaissancerobotics.com/">Renaissance Robotics</a>.
- Iâ€™m currently working on three textbooks (focusing on the first, #2 and 3 are currently on hold...):
- ðŸ“– <a href="http://robotics.ucsd.edu/rr.html">Renaissance Robotics: embedding multithreaded real-time feedback into mobile robots and cyber-physical systems</a>,
- ðŸ“– <a href="http://robotics.ucsd.edu/nr.html">Numerical Renaissance: simulation, optimization, and control</a>
- ðŸ“– <a href="http://robotics.ucsd.edu/nr.html">Renaissance Packings: simulation, optimization, and control</a>
- The first is an undergraduate-level text, and the second and third are graduate-level texts.
- I am using this github repository to store all the codes I develop associated with these three projects (<a href="https://github.com/tbewley/RR">RR</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tbewley/NR">NR</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tbewley/NR">RP</a>).
- In addition (time permitting), I may post various other projects here that I'd like to share with the world. 
- ðŸ“« For bug reports related to the codes, I prefer normal github style pull requests.
- ðŸ“« Please reach out to me at tbewley@ucsd.edu with book typos/suggestions, broken links, and other questions/suggestions.
