- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tbewley, aka Thomas Bewley.  I am a professor at UC San Diego, and the founder of <a href="https://www.renaissancerobotics.com/">Renaissance Robotics</a>.  More details on me are, including links to my published papers, and a record of my education and visiting appointments (most recently at USAFA and JPL), are in my <a href="http://robotics.ucsd.edu/CV.pdf">CV</a>.
- I have four textbooks in my long term plan (focusing now mostly on SR, RR will hopefully be finished shortly thereafter.  I will dive back into NR, and restart work on RR, in due course...):
- ðŸ“– <a href="http://robotics.ucsd.edu/SR.pdf">Structural Renaissance: a modern first course in engineering analysis and design</a> (SR),
- ðŸ“– <a href="http://robotics.ucsd.edu/RR.pdf">Renaissance Robotics: embedding multithreaded real-time feedback into mobile robots and cyber-physical systems</a> (RR),
- ðŸ“– <a href="http://robotics.ucsd.edu/NR.pdf">Numerical Renaissance: simulation, optimization, and control</a> (NR)
- ðŸ“– <a href="http://robotics.ucsd.edu/rp.html">Renaissance Packings: n-dimensional discretization for error correction, coordination, and search</a> (RP)
- SR is designed for college freshmen-level text on statics, which sets the stage for the rest of the series (including a modern approach). RR is an upper-level undergraduate study developing a rigorous framework for analysis-based design of unmanned system; NR and RP are graduate-level treatises on numerical methods and lattice theory and their numerous applications.
- I am using a consolidated Renaissance Repository (<a href="https://github.com/tbewley/RR">RR</a>) on Github to distribute all of the codes I develop associated with these four major projects, which are tightly coupled and cross referenced.
- I have also posted here a codebase for the simulation of tensegrity systems, dubbed <a href="https://github.com/tbewley/TenSim">TenSim</a>.
- ðŸ“« For bug reports related to the codes, I prefer normal github style pull requests.
- ðŸ“« Please reach out to me at tbewley@ucsd.edu with book typos/suggestions, broken links, and other questions/suggestions.
