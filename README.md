- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tbewley, aka Thomas Bewley.
- I am a professor at UC San Diego, and the founder of <a href="https://www.renaissancerobotics.com/">Renaissance Robotics</a>.
- Iâ€™m currently working on two textbooks:
- ðŸ“– Renaissance Robotics: embedding multithreaded real-time feedback into mobile robots and cyber-physical systems
- ðŸ“– Numerical Renaissance: simulation, optimization, and control
- I am using this github repository to store all the codes I develop associated with these two texts (<a href="https://github.com/tbewley/RR">RR</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tbewley/NR">NR</a>),
- in addition (time permitting) to various other projects I am working on that I'd like to share with the world. 
- ðŸ“« For bug reports, I prefer normal github style pull requests; feel free reach out to me at bewley@eng.ucsd.edu with other questions.
